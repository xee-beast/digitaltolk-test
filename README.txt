My thoughts on improvement for BookingController

- Some methods in the controller seem to handle multiple aspects of booking management. For example, distanceFeed updates distance/time, but also modifies admin comments, flags, and other fields. Ideally, these might be separated for better organization and maintainability.
- While the controller handles various actions, it's unclear if there's robust input validation. Its a good practice to always validate and sanitize user-provided data before proceeding with database interactions.
- Some inconsistencies exist in naming conventions (camelCase vs. snake_case)
- Methods like acceptJob and acceptJobWithId seem quite similar. I think they could be consolidated.

In the bookingController I have updated the one method only for now i.e
- distanceFeed => into two methods updateDistanceAndTime() and updateBookingStatus()
- I have not updated the corresponding repository for them but they should be simple

For BookingRepository I have same concerns as well
- Fat Methods
- if its laravel then we could have used magic methods or bulk update at many places
- We should have separate class for mailer and use if instead of initialing and using mailer again and again
- could have used CASE in place of IF - ELSE IFs
- Calling a model in loop could lead to performance issues
- Hard to understand we have some columns having string for condition like $job->certified == 'yes' certified should be boolean


overall, there are many things that could be changes or updated here but depends on the scope and data we have.
